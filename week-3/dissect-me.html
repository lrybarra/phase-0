      <header>What are the benefits of version control?</header>

      Version control allow software developers to have the ability to have
      a history of the changes made to a software project. This is beneficical
      in many ways, including the freedom to work on new features without
      having to worry about breaking the master copy of the software.

      The master copy, or 'master branch' is the latest working copy of the
      software. When working with a team, several developers can be working
      at the same time by using version control, and they can keep track
      of who makes what.


        How does git help you keep track of changes?

        Git helps you create new branches of your project, and there is a
        specific process one must go through in order to merge the new branch
        back into the master branch.

        With git, you create a copy of the project and then make changes to
        it. When you make changes to the project, it is best practice to
        summarize the details of the changes. This way, new developers can be
        caught up to speed when joining a project.

        You can check the git log to see all the changes that have been made
        in the project's history.

    25,000 engineers collaborating in one huge code repository sounds like a logistical nightmare. Could one sleep-deprived, grumpy developer make a single tiny mistake and take down the one thing (Google Hangouts) getting millions of Millennials through the workday? Is there a conference room large enough to house 25,000 developers working on the same project each day? Are thousands of man-hours wasted in duplicative work each day due to communication lapses across the 25,000 code maestros? Thankfully for us and for Google, thereâ€™s git.

        Why use GitHub to store your code?

        Because GitHub is a social site used by developers all around the world,
        and is an implementation of git on the web. You can work on a software
        project from different machines, and developers who may not be in your
        network can do the same.

        GitHub features an easy to use interface and can be customized with a
        profile, allowing developers to showcase their own uniqueness.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

  <div>, <p>, <h1>, <html>, <img>, <a>. These seem to be among the most used and useful tags in HTML. Hopefully, as I get more experience with this language I will begin more familiar with the semantic tags as I add them to my repertoire.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

  Elements are laid out on a page in a top down fashion, FIFO. In other words, the browser begins interpreting HTML code from the first line and then moves down a line at a time to display the elements on the page.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

  I learned about how to create a snippet using the Sublime language, I hope to commit more of the shortcuts to my memory. -->
