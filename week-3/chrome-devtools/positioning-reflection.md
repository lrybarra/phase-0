1. How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

	By Inspecting an element, you open DevTools, which allows you to view the code that makes up the webpage. Once using DevTools, one can format and position elements by simply unchecking boxes, or actually editing the code by hand. One must note that one is not changing the source file, but rather the copy that the web browser has downloaded. 

	This gives developers a playground in which to edit code whether it is simply for practice (One can never have enough practice) or for learning new ways in which to display content.

2. How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

	There are many ways to do this. One can edit the height and width of an element, the padding, the margin, and the border as well. In addition, one can edit the display property, toggling among block, inline-bock, inline, and none (which literally disappears the content from the page).

3. What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? 

	If an element's positioning type is not defined, it will default to "static". However, if Absolute is chosen, then the element is positioned in relation to its first parent that doesn't have static positioning. Relative positioning places an element where it would've landed if it had static positioning and fixed positioning anchors the element to the window. 

	a. Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

		I found myself struggling in trying to conceptualize absolute positioning, so I tried to use it in practice to learn it better. Fixed positioning was the easiest to understand since you are "gluing the element to the screen".

4. What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

	I'm not sure about the "differences", but margin is the space between the element and the edge of the page. The border is the outer edge of the element and the padding is the space between the actual content and the border.

5. What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

	This was a great challenge that was a lot of fun and I enjoyed working with my peer pair as we were both able to drive and navigate. I feel that we each learned from each other whilst moving through the challenge toward the goal. Once we got into the flow we were able to recreate each CSS scenario.
