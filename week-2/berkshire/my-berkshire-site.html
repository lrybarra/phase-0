<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

	It was awesome, I like how HTML structures elements and it is great to see code that I helped write turn into an real website. HTML is a good introduction to the joys of programming.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

  	We collaborated on this research and it felt like a good team effort. 

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

	We discussed beforehand that we would not be utilizing CSS for this website and thus didn't need to worry about the look of the site. We agreed that the most important aspect of this challenge was getting up the content of the site.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

	The simplicity of HTML seems good because it is easy to learn but (probably) difficult to master. Without needing to compile the code, we are able to see what the website looks like, which is very helpful during the design and development phase. 

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

	I think about how many of the tags are literal, e.g. <head>, <body>, <html>, and many others are intuitive, like <p> for paragraph, <br> for (line) break, and <img src> for image source. I also remember to close my tag as soon as I open it, then fill in the middle with text.
