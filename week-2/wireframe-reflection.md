What is a wireframe?

	A wireframe is a sketch or design that is one of the first steps in creating a web page. It is like an architectural blueprint of the site. A wireframe can be done in a number of different ways, including using an app or even sketching using pencil and paper. Like the foundation of a building, a wireframe has to be fundamentally strong or the website could devolve into chaos.

What are the benefits of wireframing?

	Wireframing is useful in determining how users interact with the interface. It allows designers to get a good handle on how the web page will be layed out and the content delivered without worrying about about colors, fonts, i.e. "The Look" of the site.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

	I used Mockingbird to draw up my wireframes and I did enjoy it, though I am curious about other tools and would love to do my next wireframe using just pencil and paper.

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

	I set aside a chunk of time to do the wireframes and stopped when time was up as I did not want to go down the rabbit hole.

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

	Are developers and designers really using wireframes? I used the "I Love Wireframes" site to read a few articles and determined that, yes, many are utilizing this awesome tool in their processes.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

	I enjoyed seeing the different types of wireframing possible, however I did find the website tedious to read, as the flash was bogging down my system and making it very difficult to scroll (it even crashed a couple of times).
