What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

	My site's purpose is to provide an overview of who I am and what I do (career wise). It's primary goal is to leave the user with a good understanding of those two points. My site will feature a quick blurb about me, contact information, social network links, a portfolio of coding projects, a blog, and a portfolio of my photography.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

	My target audience's interests will be hiring me or befriending me. Hopefully my site will provide a good picture to the user of whether or not to hire and/or befriend me.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

	The primary action that the user should take when coming to my site is reading the "About Me" section, followed by viewing my projects portfolio.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

	User experience is one of the key factors to take into consideration when designing a website. Although UX cannot be measured by traditional metrics, there are several useful ways to get a good idea of how to design a site. One of these methods is A / B testing, where one group of website visitors is shown the "A" version of the site while the other group is shown the "B" version of the site. 

	In the past, user experience was not something that was taken into account in the Web Design process. Instead, the developers went with what the client wanted in addition to what they themselves thought was interesting. However, now the Web Design industry puts user experience at the forefront. 

What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

	User experience design is essentially planning and implementing websites with users in the mind from the get go. It is valuable because users have specific needs and if a site is designed poorly then users will simply not visit the site. In other words, UX design can make or break a website. 

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

	The reading was a bit tedious in that there were many distractions (advertisements, pictures, links) on the page when really I just wanted to get the most out of the actual content.
