Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

A repository is a collection of files that form a project, cloning this collection to your local computer is a way for you to work on it on your own computer.
> First you will click the New Repository button, once it is created you must copy the URL from the box and go to your terminal and type "git clone ", 
then paste the URL 

Describe what open source means.
> Open source is a type of software that you can use and see the source code for. In other words, the "source" code is "open" to public viewing.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
> I like the fact that Open Source allows others to make changes to a piece of software that I have written. In addition, I am interested in finding some 
application that I enjoy using and then seeing the source code for viewing or editing. It makes me a little nervous to have my code exposed for all to see.
However, the benefits are plentiful.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
> It is important to add a license to your software so that others can clearly understand the restrictions associated with its use / distribution / change.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
> I am still very new to version control, so going through the exercises began to open up this world for me. Conceptually, I understand version control but in
practice it was difficult at first to understand the commands. I am looking forward to working more with git and GitHub.
