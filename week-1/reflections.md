# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

I learned about the Pomodoro technique and the Fogg Method, two concepts I had not previously been familiar with. In addition, I read more about meditation (something I’ve been attempting to consistently do for the past few months) and the growth vs fixed mindsets.

Time boxing is setting aside a discrete amount of time in which to perform a task, then stopping when that time is expired and reflecting on what was done. This is an alternative to performing a task until the task is done, irrespective of time. Currently, I make daily to do lists, weekly & monthly goal lists, and try to keep an 8-5, Monday – Friday schedule. My strategy works when I apply it, however I believe that it can always be enhanced and refactored.

I will definitely give the Fogg Method a hearty try. My overall plan for Phase 0 planning will combine my current techniques mixed with meditation and some of the new strategies I learned today.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell is a program that allows you to perform basic filesystem processes and harness the power of your machine and operating system. Bash is a Unix shell.

The most challenging thing about this material was thinking about how to master shell scripting. Yes I was able to execute all commands.

To me, cd and pwd are the most important to know because they form a very strong foundation of understanding the basic concepts of using the command line. Pipe arguments are very important because they can be used to perform very complex tasks with only one line of code.

pwd - print working directory
ls - list files
mv - move files
cd - change directory
../ - go up one directory
touch - make new file
mkdir - create directory
less - page through text in a file
rmdir - delete directory
rm - delete file
help - get help

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection  

I would first give a quick summary about what creating, forking, and cloning were, then I would proceed to explain each in detail. Finally, I would add the proper syntax to get the new person to get started.

I would fork a repository instead of creating a new one when I wanted to work with an already existing repository that I did not have access to change, thus keeping my code separate.

I previously had GitHub account and did not have any trouble setting it up. However, I did have some issues setting up my environment in Windows, so I began using Cloud9 and did not meet any issues in setting up my workspace.
