Challenge 4.2 - Release 1

1. What does puts do?

> puts returns nil and prints to the console

2. What is an integer? What is a float?

> an Integer is a number without a decimal point, a "whole number". Whereas a "float" or floating-point number is a number with a decimal point.  "Floats" are used extensively for academic purposes and 3D graphics (think Pixar or Dreamworks Animation).

3. What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

> Integer division will return an Integer, regardless of whether a not there is a remainder. Float division will indeed return a number with a decimal point, so it is the most precise form of division. However, both types of division are "correct". Say you have 5 hours of free time, and you can have three entertainment options. You can watch a 2 hour movie, a 2 hour basketball game, and/or a 2 hour documentary. You can either watch the whole thing or nothing. With integer division, you can divide your time appropriately. 5 hours divided by two hours leaves two options.

```ruby

# how many hours in a year ?
# days times 24 hours

puts 360 * 24 
puts " hours in a year!"

# how many minutes in a decade ?
# (360 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes) * 10 

puts 360 * 24 * 60 * 10 
puts " minutes in a decade!"

```

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

	Ruby calculates the results of these operations with the following symbols: + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, and / for division

What is the difference between integers and floats?

	Integers have decimal points while floats do not.

What is the difference between integer and float division?

	Integer division will return an Integer, regardless of whether a not there is a remainder. Float division will indeed return a number with a decimal point, so it is the most precise form of division. However, both types of division are "correct". Say you have 5 hours of free time, and you can have three entertainment options. You can watch a 2 hour movie, a 2 hour basketball game, and/or a 2 hour documentary.

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

	Strings are collections of characters like letters, numbers, and symbols. You would use them as you would use words and sentences in a literary context.

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

	Local variables are like bins that store values. You would use them when you want to access the same bit of information more than once. You also want to use them to store results of arithmetic operations. 

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

	That's exactly how I would describe it. A quick review of basic computer programming concepts.
