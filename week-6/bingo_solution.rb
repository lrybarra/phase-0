# A Nested Array to Model a Bingo Board SOLO CHALLENGE

# I spent 8 hours on this challenge.


# Release 0: Pseudocode
# Outline: Create a BINGO board game!

# Create a method to generate a letter ( b, i, n, g, o) and a number (1-100)
  #fill in the outline here
  # generate random number from 0-4 (inclusive) and use this to determine letter
  # generate random number from 1-100 (inclusive)
  # pass the "ball" (e.g. G44) to called columnn

# Check the called column for the number called.
  #fill in the outline here
  # check all five board positions for the number
  # utilize logic or method that will return true / false

# If the number is in the column, replace with an 'x'
  #fill in the outline here
  # IF TRUE (see above method), simply assign 'X' to this position

# Display a column to the console
  #fill in the outline here
  # pass in letter of column that you want to display
  # print each number in that column to a new line

# Display the board to the console (prettily)
  #fill in the outline here
  # print B I N G O across top of board
  # optional lines 
  # print all numbers and X's
  # no free space? :'(

#Reflection
=begin

How difficult was pseudocoding this challenge? What do you think of your pseudocoding style?

> It was not difficult to pseudocode for this challenge, I think my style is improving and it 
  definitely gives me a good starting point for coding. Even if the final product is different from
  the pseudocode steps, I feel that it is beneficial. 

What are the benefits of using a class for this challenge?

> The two biggest benefits are having methods that will do the same thing over and over again,
  such as generating a "call" or displaying the board. By having the board numbers as class attributes,
  we are able to easily check for matches.

How can you access coordinates in a nested array?

> nested_array[i][j] - i selects the array, j selects the element of the selected array

What methods did you use to access and modify the array?

> brackets and equals signs

Give an example of a new method you learned while reviewing the Ruby docs. Based on what you see in the docs, what purpose does it serve, and how is it called?

> Array#sample(n) - returns n random elements from an array

How did you determine what should be an instance variable versus a local variable?

> Anything related to the actual board was an instance variable and simple rows and columns were able
  to be local variables.

What do you feel is most improved in your refactored solution?

> The check method which I reduced to three lines. Also, I was able to generate a legal Bingo board and 
  generate "legal" calls.
